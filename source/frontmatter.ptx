        <p>
            This is the second part of the two part lab manual for MTH111 and MTH112 at Portland
            Community College. The first chapter is "Chapter 5" to align with the first portion of
            the lab manual. 

            This lab manual was designed with the intent of being used in the following manner. In
            each section:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Students will complete the Preparation Exercises before receiving
                        instruction on the content. Some instructors will have students do this
                        before coming to class, while others might do it as a warmup in class.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        There will be some instructor-led presentation of the content. This may be a
                        formal class lecture, a discovery activity, a video lecture, or something
                        else.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Students will then engage in Practice Exercises in a group setting to
                        reinforce their initial understanding of the foundational concepts.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        An instructor will then assign one or more group activities. Because many of
                        these activities are webbased and instructors can choose to use different
                        activities, we have not included any of the possible activities in this
                        document.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The Definitions are meant to provide a single location for all definitions
                        and some key concepts. Students can use this as a resource after having
                        covered the topics in class.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Students will complete some or all of the Exit Exercises, as decided by
                        their instructor, to summarize their understanding of key concepts.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In general, not every section of this lab manual will take the same amount
                        of class time. Some sectionsmight be half-day topics, while others could be
                        two-day topics.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Each instructor will identify for their class which exercises will be
                        submitted as part of the course grade.
                    </p>
                </li>
