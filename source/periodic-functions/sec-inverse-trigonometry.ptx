                    A research student is working with a culture of bacteria that doubles in size every 13 minutes.  The initial population count was 1350 bacteria.  Find an exponential function that expresses the bacteria population, <m>P</m>, as a function of <m>t</m>, the number of <em>hours</em> after the experiment began.
