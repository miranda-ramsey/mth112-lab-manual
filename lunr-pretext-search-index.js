  "body": " Preface  This is the second part of the two part lab manual for MTH111 and MTH112 at Portland Community College. The first chapter is \"Chapter 5\" to align with the first portion of the lab manual. This lab manual was designed with the intent of being used in the following manner. In each section:   Students will complete the Preparation Exercises before receiving instruction on the content. Some instructors will have students do this before coming to class, while others might do it as a warmup in class.    There will be some instructor-led presentation of the content. This may be a formal class lecture, a discovery activity, a video lecture, or something else.    Students will then engage in Practice Exercises in a group setting to reinforce their initial understanding of the foundational concepts.    An instructor will then assign one or more group activities. Because many of these activities are webbased and instructors can choose to use different activities, we have not included any of the possible activities in this document.    The Definitions are meant to provide a single location for all definitions and some key concepts. Students can use this as a resource after having covered the topics in class.    Students will complete some or all of the Exit Exercises, as decided by their instructor, to summarize their understanding of key concepts.    In general, not every section of this lab manual will take the same amount of class time. Some sectionsmight be half-day topics, while others could be two-day topics.    Each instructor will identify for their class which exercises will be submitted as part of the course grade.     Course Resource Links:   Algebra and Trigonometry 2e       MTH 112 Supplement        "

  "body": " Angles   In this section, we'll draw angles in standard position, convert between degrees and radians and degrees-minutes-seconds, find coterminal angles, and find the length of a circular arc.    Textbook Reference  This relates to content in 7.1 of Algebra and Trigonometry 2e .    Preparation Exercises    Answer the following without using a calculator.

Find the arc length of on a circle of radius with an interior angle of 20        Definitions   Angle   An angle is formed when two lines intersect at a point. We can measure the “size” of this angle in degrees or radians.     Ray   A ray is a portion of a line that starts at a point and extends infinitely in one direction.     Degree   A degree is an angle measurement equal to of a full rotation.     Right Angle   A right angle is an angle of 90 .     Radian   A radian is a unit of measurement of angle size, and 1 radian is defined to be the angle that is made when the arc length for that angle on a circle of radius 1 is equal to 1.

Angles measured from initial to terminal side in a counterclockwise direction are positive. Angles measured from initial to terminal side clockwise are negative.     Standard Position   An angle is said to be in standard position if the initial and terminal sides of the angle meet at the origin and the initial side of the angle is along the positive x-axis.     Coterminal   Two angles are coterminal if their initial and terminal sides align, but they differ by an integer number of full rotations. In standard position, this means that the two angles are “in the same place” are different by some integer multiple of 360 (or radians).     Arc length   An arc length is a distance along a part of the circumference of a circle. A formula for arc length is , where stands for arc length along a circle of radius , with an interior angle centered at the center of the circle.    Coterminal angles and    An angle drawn in standard position is indicated in two ways. Beginning with an initial side along the positive -axis and ending with a terminal side in the second quadrant, the angle in the counter- clockwise direction is labeled and the angle in the clockwise direction is labeled . The segment of the circumference of the circle between the initial and terminal sides of is the arc subtended by , and the length measure of that arc is the arc length for angle .         Exit Exercises    Explain why -90 is not the same as 270 .      Convert 34 29 24 to decimal degrees.      Convert the angle 144 to radians. Write your answer in exact form as a fraction with in it.      How big of an arc length will an angle of radians create on a circle of radius 6? Draw this angle and arc length on the circle of radius 6 provided.         On a scale of 1 5, how are you feeling with the concepts related to the graphical behaviors of functions?    --> "
